* What is this?
This is a _barebone_ IRC client. 

* How to Run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein clean
lein deps
java -cp 'lib/*:src/' clojure.main src/start_server.clj
#+END_SRC


Wait 10 seconds. Then navigate to:
http://localhost:3005/


Within a minute, you'll see irc freenode server output.
The client will automatically join irc://irc.freenode.org/#bot-testing.
Type message in textbox to chat in channel.


If you don't see any server output. Try refreshing the browser. Then PM the clj-powered-bot to cause server output.

* Why did I built it?
Out of curiosity.

Here are some of the technologies I played around with:
+ websockets
+ clojure (and futures)
+ lamina (like GO channels)
+ aleph (serving http requests with channels)
+ compojure (like django)
+ hiccup (DSL for HTML)
